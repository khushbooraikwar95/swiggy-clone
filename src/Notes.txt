What is UseState ?

useState is just a javascript function provided us by facebook developer,
to create a local state variable in out component
to use that we first do named import then call this function inside our
component before return method. It returns an Array which contains two parameter
first is the variable name we want to use and another is the function to update that variable
 const [searchText, setSearchText] = useState("")

 React uses the one way data binding for that we use useState, other frameworks
 like Angular Js they uses Two way data binding which is not good and bery non-performent

Interview Question:
Why do we need this state varibales when we have the local variables?
Answer: Suppose we a normal variables and Whenever the variable changes
react would not know who updated the varibale, to do that everytime you want this vairbale to be in sink with UI,
thats why you need to use state variable. becuase all its have a one way binding concept


Hooks:
Never ever write a useState in If Else statement,
ForLoops
